## What is a Solar Router / Diverter ?

A _Solar Router_ allows to redirect the solar production excess to some appliances instead of returning it to the grid.
The particularity of a solar router is that it will dim the voltage and power sent to the appliance in order to match the excess production, in contrary to a simple relay that would just switch on/off the appliance without controlling its power.

A _Solar Router_ is usually connected to the resistance of a water tank and will heat the water when there is production excess.

A solar router can also do more things, like controlling (on/off) the activation of other appliances (with the grid normal voltage and not the dimmed voltage) in case the excess reaches a threshold. For example, one could activate a pump, pool heater, etc if the excess goes above a specific amount, so that this appliance gets the priority over heating the water tank.

A router can also schedule some forced heating of the water tank to ensure the water reaches a safe temperature, and consequently bypass the dimmed voltage. This is called a bypass relay.

## Home Assistant Solar Diverter Features

- **Home Assistant Integration**
- **PID Controller**
- **Routing Modes** (`OFF` / `Automatic` / `Manual`)

It is possible to further enhance with temperature sensor, relays, etc, all managed from Home Assistant.

## Hardware

All the components can be bought at [https://www.shelly.com/](https://www.shelly.com/), except the voltage regulator, where you can find some links [on my website](../build#voltage-regulators)

Some additional hardware are required depending on the installation.
**Please select the amperage according to your needs.**

- A 2A breaker for the Shelly electric circuit
- A 16A or 20A breaker for your water tank (resistance) electric circuit
- A 25A relay or contactor for the bypass relay (to force a heating) for the water tank electric circuit
- A protection box for the Shelly

See also [YaSolR Build page](https://yasolr.carbou.me/build#voltage-regulators) for some references and heat sinks.

## Wiring

The wiring is quite simple and can be done by anyone with some basic knowledge of electricity.

It is the same as for the [Shelly Solar Diverter](2024-07-01_shelly_solar_diverter.md).
